The Automatic test scores recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Networks

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am honored for this opportunity and I would love to show you my work portfolio including one program and one related paper.

The document test is one of my python-based programs. It is mainly about one of the applications of machine learning as well as neural network related studies. In this program, I have established a neural network model called CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) in order to address the needs of handwritten numbers recognition, which, form my view, has both practical significance and research value.

•	You may open and test it through Python language development tools, and PyCharm is recommended since I finished it on the surrounding basis of Python 3.7 and OpenCV 3.4.

•	The interrelated paper was written by myself in simplified Chinese during the senior year of my undergraduate study, and it is called The Automatic test scores recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
